# 👋 Hi
I’m @lhtat, some call me by my real name Lukas. But that's up to you 😉 

## 👀 I’m interested in...
... a lot of things. Mostly I focus on PowerShell, Docker, Python and a lot of other scripting. I always want to find a way to automate certain tasks with a simple command on the command line or a click in some fancy UI. So I still have a lot to learn, especially when it comes to Python. But that is what motivates me, learning learning learning. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
... yes,  I'm learning. And please sit back for a moment and take some time to think about this: What a time to be able to learn such great things from so many fantastic people all over the world. It is a privilege to be able to learn, and we should be grateful for it.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
